For example, if you own a security tool whose reports contain references to CVE IDs, you may then access fix information in a separate database that is compatible with CVE. CVE also provides you with a baseline for evaluating the coverage of your tools. With CVE’s common identifiers, you’ll know exactly what each tool covers allowing you to determine which tools are most effective and appropriate for your organization’s needs.",
					"In addition, if the security advisories your organization receives include CVEs, you can see if your vulnerability scanners check for this threat and then determine whether your intrusion detection system has the appropriate attack signatures to identify attempts to exploit particular vulnerabilities.

					"When the CVE effort first began in 1999 and vulnerabilities were discovered and published less frequently than they are today, CVEs were issued &quot;candidate&quot; or &quot;entry&quot; status, where candidate status indicated that the identifier was under review for inclusion on the CVE List and entry status indicated that the identifier has been formally accepted to the list. CVEs with candidate status used the CAN-prefix (e.g., &quot;CAN-1999-0067&quot;), while CVEs with entry status used the CVE-prefix (e.g., &quot;CVE-1999-0067&quot;). This meant that the individual identifier numbers themselves would need to be changed once a candidate had been updated to entry status, placing a significant burden on the numerous vendors and organizations around the world that would in turn need to update their tools and processes to accommodate the replacement identifier numbers. This became especially burdensome as the volume of vulnerabilities being discovered and added to the CVE List increased each year (CVE Records are now added to the CVE website on a daily basis). Therefore, at the request of the community, as of 2005 all CVE Records now use the CVE-prefix and are immediately usable by the community. While references and other supporting information may be updated over time, the CVE ID itself does not change once it has been assigned to an issue."
