Prior to this step, individual Board members may contact the member of concern directly, or may choose to voice their concerns through the Secretariat, so that issues are effectively communicated to the member of concern so that an understanding of the situation is developed in an effort to arrive at a fair outcome.

Therefore, Board members have a responsibility to participate by voting. Members will lose voting privileges if they do not vote in at least one of the three previous (consecutive) Board votes. Votes to abstain count toward participation and toward a quorum. Votes that are terminated before the stated voting period because an early decision is reached, do not count as a part of the three previous votes.
