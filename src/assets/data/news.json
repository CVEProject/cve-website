In fact, this may have been the case with the vulnerability researcher who wrote a <a target='_blank' href='https://www.darkreading.com/vulnerabilities-threats/microsoft-advisories-are-getting-worse'>commentary on Dark Reading</a> a few months ago saying that CVE Records descriptions from some CNAs had become too short and were no longer useful.

Effective cybersecurity requires solutions at scale. A key metric that the CVE Program tracks is CNA-LR production. CNA-LRs assign CVE IDs and publish CVE Records for vulnerabilities that are not in another CNA’s scope. At the end of 2016, the MITRE CNA-LR published 100% of CVE Records. At the end of Q2 2023, CNA-LRs (MITRE, CISA) published 23% of the program total while concurrently producing more records than ever before. This demonstrates the value of the CVE whole-of-world federated partnership model."

Using the GTD workflow system, we set the foundation for building the workflow in Product Security for handling vulnerabilities. The idea was to track the issues; we wanted to give them all an ID for clarity. We decided to invest our time in CVEs fully as a means to do so. It was the right way to have an industry-wide naming system for vulnerabilities."

Even in case of a backport, the CVE numbering schema fits backport fixes, and we could discuss the same issue. This is an open-source community approach that we fully believe in, and it is for the community that we maintain this approach to identification."

Often the decision is to defer fixing until later, only to be overcome by events or forgotten.” Worse, “vulnerability management programs rely too heavily on the CVSS Base score, produced by vendors and the National Vulnerability Database, in determining the severity and impact of the vulnerability on their operational practices. Vulnerability Management teams often rely solely on the CVSS score assigned to a specific CVE to decide whether or not to fix the CVE in their environment.”"

Of the six vulnerabilities recently added to the KEV, four had CVEs assigned in 2013 and one in 2010. If you are one of the organizations that bases their patching decisions on CVSS scores, do yourself a favor, subscribe to the KEV updates and add fixing those listed in the KEV catalog a priority in your vulnerability management process. It will be a positive step in the right direction.”"

But let us start at the true beginning: <a href='/PartnerInformation/ListofPartners/partner/VulDB'>VulDB</a> launched in 1997. It was a different time back then. When people were talking about vulnerabilities or exploits, they were talking about products: “Did you hear about the new wu-ftpd exploit?” Identifying issues was somehow easier because there were not that many of them, especially not the ones that really drew interest by attackers. If there was potential confusion, people were referring to version numbers of affected products or mentioned technical details such as vulnerable files or exploited functions."

Duplicate detection became harder, again, because there are a lot of new vulnerabilities published nowadays (approximately 76 per day in 2022, compared to 40 in 2016) and many more communication channels available. In earlier days, reading mailing lists and collecting vendor advisories was enough.

As defined in the <i><a href='/ResourcesSupport/AllResources/CNARules'>CNA Rules</a></i>, every CNA requires a specific scope. For VulDB to become a CNA, our scope needed to be broader than the CNA Rules currently defines. We discussed this issue with the CVE Program and were able to agree upon a product-independent scope. Primarily, we will assign CVEs for products not covered by other CNAs, but we are also allowed to negotiate vulnerability processing with other CNAs. Security researchers appreciate this possibility.<strong>*</strong>"

At that time, vulnerabilities were often an issue of IT and software vendors, but rarely affected industrial vendors like Siemens. The entire Operational Technologies (OT) world was still considering industrial environments as separated infrastructures, where vulnerabilities might not be exploited due to strong firewalls around factories' infrastructure. In addition, lifetimes of industrial devices were often 20+ years, thus some devices were used over incredible time frames - viewed from an IT perspective. This has fundamentally changed over the last years; <i>digitalization</i> has become not just a buzzword, but now more and more, a reality. OT is now closely connected to external services and networks, and industrial equipment has become powerful devices with major parts in software. Thus, in OT environments, it was vital to adopt widely used software paradigms like vulnerability handling or publishing advisories to make our customers aware of fixed vulnerabilities. Acting as a central PSIRT for all Siemens products, we supported all of our businesses in this changing world, which is a quite challenging task considering the broadness of the Siemens product portfolio and the impressive organizational size of our globally acting company."

          "content": "We started with the publication of our first advisories in 2011 on our <a target='_blank' href='https://new.siemens.com/global/en/products/services/cert.html'>ProductCERT web page</a>, where we already used standards like CVE and <a target='_blank' href='https://www.first.org/cvss/'>Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)</a> to offer valuable vulnerability information to our customers. Unlike the usual way in IT, we published our advisories in PDF format, which could be printed and read by OT staff, and later we also offered other formats like HTML and CVRF. At that initial time, we received most reports via other CERTs, and we saw quite fast, that we needed to obtain our CVE numbers directly from MITRE for practical reasons. Over the years we increased steadily the number of published advisories and became more and more transparent on our fixed vulnerabilities. We became known to the <a target='_blank' href='https://new.siemens.com/global/en/products/services/cert/hall-of-thanks.html'>researchers</a> and got more vulnerability reports from them directly. In 2017, we partnered with the CVE Program as a <a href='/ResourcesSupport/Glossary?activeTerm=glossaryCNA'>CNA</a> and we were happy that we then were able to have a much easier handling of those CVE number bands, allowing us to increase automation on the advisories as well. At the end of 2018, we introduced our <a target='_blank' href='https://new.siemens.com/global/en/company/stories/research-technologies/cybersecurity/rhythm-for-security.html'>advisory day</a>, and since then all advisories (with some exceptions of a few out-of-band publications) were issued in a regular monthly cycle. This allows our customers to apply all Siemens patches in the same maintenance window as other major software vendors. Considering the variety of our businesses, this was an enormous challenge and was only possible with the great support of our product development teams."
