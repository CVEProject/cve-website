In this case the security policy of the LLM allowed researchers to provide additional training facts and reupload the model for others to use. If the security policy allows this, then this “bad security outcome” would not be considered a CVE, even if those modifications are malicious in nature. Other examples that would not receive CVE assignments would be cases of racial or gender bias in various LLM technologies.

This means anyone still using CVE Record data from that legacy website could be missing significant data about the vulnerability as the records on that site have been down converted from the new format to the old record format and it’s not a 1:1 conversion because of all the new fields in the new structured format. In fact, this may have been the case with the vulnerability researcher who wrote a <a target='_blank' href='https://www.darkreading.com/vulnerabilities-threats/microsoft-advisories-are-getting-worse'>commentary on Dark Reading</a> a few months ago saying that CVE Records descriptions from some CNAs had become too short and were no longer useful.

CNA-LRs assign CVE IDs and publish CVE Records for vulnerabilities that are not in another CNA’s scope. At the end of 2016, the MITRE CNA-LR published 100% of CVE Records. At the end of Q2 2023, CNA-LRs (MITRE, CISA) published 23% of the program total while concurrently producing more records than ever before.

Often the decision is to defer fixing until later, only to be overcome by events or forgotten.” Worse, “vulnerability management programs rely too heavily on the CVSS Base score, produced by vendors and the National Vulnerability Database, in determining the severity and impact of the vulnerability on their operational practices. Vulnerability Management teams often rely solely on the CVSS score assigned to a specific CVE to decide whether or not to fix the CVE in their environment.”"

Of the six vulnerabilities recently added to the KEV, four had CVEs assigned in 2013 and one in 2010. If you are one of the organizations that bases their patching decisions on CVSS scores, do yourself a favor, subscribe to the KEV updates and add fixing those listed in the KEV catalog a priority in your vulnerability management process. It will be a positive step in the right direction.”"

We do not use such a tagging, but we do add a confidence level to every commit to help users put data into quality context. Duplicate detection became harder, again, because there are a lot of new vulnerabilities published nowadays (approximately 76 per day in 2022, compared to 40 in 2016) and many more communication channels available. In earlier days, reading mailing lists and collecting vendor advisories was enough. Today, monitoring code repositories, social media, and darknet marketplaces are even more important, especially if you want to cover zero-day vulnerabilities."

For VulDB to become a CNA, our scope needed to be broader than the CNA Rules currently defines. We discussed this issue with the CVE Program and were able to agree upon a product-independent scope. Primarily, we will assign CVEs for products not covered by other CNAs, but we are also allowed to negotiate vulnerability processing with other CNAs.

At that time, vulnerabilities were often an issue of IT and software vendors, but rarely affected industrial vendors like Siemens. The entire Operational Technologies (OT) world was still considering industrial environments as separated infrastructures, where vulnerabilities might not be exploited due to strong firewalls around factories' infrastructure. In addition, lifetimes of industrial devices were often 20+ years, thus some devices were used over incredible time frames - viewed from an IT perspective. This has fundamentally changed over the last years; <i>digitalization</i> has become not just a buzzword, but now more and more, a reality. OT is now closely connected to external services and networks, and industrial equipment has become powerful devices with major parts in software. Thus, in OT environments, it was vital to adopt widely used software paradigms like vulnerability handling or publishing advisories to make our customers aware of fixed vulnerabilities. Acting as a central PSIRT for all Siemens products, we supported all of our businesses in this changing world, which is a quite challenging task considering the broadness of the Siemens product portfolio and the impressive organizational size of our globally acting company."

Unlike the usual way in IT, we published our advisories in PDF format, which could be printed and read by OT staff, and later we also offered other formats like HTML and CVRF. At that initial time, we received most reports via other CERTs, and we saw quite fast, that we needed to obtain our CVE numbers directly from MITRE for practical reasons. Over the years we increased steadily the number of published advisories and became more and more transparent on our fixed vulnerabilities. We became known to the <a target='_blank' href='https://new.siemens.com/global/en/products/services/cert/hall-of-thanks.html'>researchers</a> and got more vulnerability reports from them directly. In 2017, we partnered with the CVE Program as a <a href='/ResourcesSupport/Glossary?activeTerm=glossaryCNA'>CNA</a> and we were happy that we then were able to have a much easier handling of those CVE number bands, allowing us to increase automation on the advisories as well. At the end of 2018, we introduced our <a target='_blank' href='https://new.siemens.com/global/en/company/stories/research-technologies/cybersecurity/rhythm-for-security.html'>advisory day</a>, and since then all advisories (with some exceptions of a few out-of-band publications) were issued in a regular monthly cycle. This allows our customers to apply all Siemens patches in the same maintenance window as other major software vendors. Considering the variety of our businesses, this was an enormous challenge and was only possible with the great support of our product development teams."
