          "content": "Our story as a <a href='/ProgramOrganization/CNAs'>CNA</a> is a bit different than others. But let us start at the true beginning: <a href='/PartnerInformation/ListofPartners/partner/VulDB'>VulDB</a> launched in 1997. It was a different time back then. When people were talking about vulnerabilities or exploits, they were talking about products: “Did you hear about the new wu-ftpd exploit?” Identifying issues was somehow easier because there were not that many of them, especially not the ones that really drew interest by attackers. If there was potential confusion, people were referring to version numbers of affected products or mentioned technical details such as vulnerable files or exploited functions."
        },
        {
           "contentnewsType": "paragraph", 
           "content": "When CVE was introduced in 1999, I was personally very skeptical. It sounded like a good idea, but I was doubtful that the program would be able to reach the level of technical flexibility and professionalism that would be required to add a sustainable benefit to the industry. I must admit, I was wrong to a large degree."
        },
        {
           "contentnewsType": "paragraph",

        },
        {
           "contentnewsType": "paragraph", 
           "content": "Over the years, CVE made a lot of things easier for us. We are a vulnerability database with a scope that is different than vendor CNAs or vulnerability catalogs covering specific product types. We add everything that can be exploited in software or hardware. We are very close to hosting 200,000 entries in our database."
        },
        {
           "contentnewsType": "paragraph", 
           "content": "Even though we share a very similar philosophy to the CVE Program, our approach slightly differs. For example, we also accept submissions for vulnerabilities in malware. That is because we think that on top of the malicious code, additional attack surfaces are introduced, which increases the risk and people should know about this. You would be surprised how much malware comes with buffer overflows, directory traversal possibilities, and permission issues."

In these rare cases, we use merge and forward capabilities to redirect users to the right entries. All edits are documented in a commit history, rendering changes very transparent."

        {
           "contentnewsType": "paragraph", 
           "content": "At the beginning, CVE used the now obsolete CNA tag (“candidate”) to deal with new entries. We do not use such a tagging, but we do add a confidence level to every commit to help users put data into quality context. Duplicate detection became harder, again, because there are a lot of new vulnerabilities published nowadays (approximately 76 per day in 2022, compared to 40 in 2016) and many more communication channels available. In earlier days, reading mailing lists and collecting vendor advisories was enough. Today, monitoring code repositories, social media, and darknet marketplaces are even more important, especially if you want to cover zero-day vulnerabilities."

           "contentnewsType": "paragraph",

We are working with CVE data daily and are aware of the importance of the program for the cybersecurity industry, as well as the demanding requirements that come with such importance."

        {
           "contentnewsType": "paragraph", 
           "content": "In 2021, we decided to contact the CVE Program to discuss possibilities of a collaboration. It was very important for us to remain independent while also being a CNA. As defined in the <i><a href='/ResourcesSupport/AllResources/CNARules'>CNA Rules</a></i>, every CNA requires a specific scope. For VulDB to become a CNA, our scope needed to be broader than the CNA Rules currently defines. We discussed this issue with the CVE Program and were able to agree upon a product-independent scope. Primarily, we will assign CVEs for products not covered by other CNAs, but we are also allowed to negotiate vulnerability processing with other CNAs. If a vendor does not want to handle a vulnerability, but it is a vulnerability as defined by the CNA Rules, we may cover it. Security researchers appreciate this possibility."

           "content": "<a href='/ResourcesSupport/AllResources/CNARules#section_7-2_how_many_vulnerabilities'>CNA Rule 7.2, “How Many Vulnerabilities?</a>”, defines a clear requirement for splitting and merging entries. Our own philosophy differs slightly. Not much, but enough to add another level of complexity for our data team. If there is one CVE, we might have to split it into multiple entries in VulDB or there are several CVEs available for a single entry."
        },
        {
           "contentnewsType": "paragraph", 
           "content": "Occasionally, customers want to understand the reason why we split or merge entries.  We enjoy these exchanges of the philosophical nature of vulnerabilities. There is a lot of room for ideas that can enrich and improve our industry. Some examples are product assignments, version handling, risk ratings, and vulnerability class definitions, to just name a few. Projects like <a href='https://nvd.nist.gov/products/cpe' target='_blank'>CPE</a>, <a href='https://www.first.org/cvss/specification-document' target='_blank'>CVSS</a>, <a href='https://cwe.mitre.org/' target='_blank'>CWE</a>, and <a href='https://attack.mitre.org/' target='_blank'>ATT&CK</a> took the role of CVE in their respective fields. They are often not perfect solutions, but do help to introduce a common language."

           "contentnewsType": "paragraph", 
           "content": "Unfortunately, it is often forgotten that vulnerability management is one of the main pillars of cyber security. Perhaps because for some, it might not spark the glamorous appeal of new topics like artificial intelligence and blockchain, but for us it does. Without vulnerability management, there will be no new secure technologies."

This re-introduced the early challenges of duplicate detection before the CVE era. But we profit from a lot of experience and optimized processes compiled over decades. We are very confident and happy to be a part of something important like the CVE Program."

At that time, vulnerabilities were often an issue of IT and software vendors, but rarely affected industrial vendors like Siemens. The entire Operational Technologies (OT) world was still considering industrial environments as separated infrastructures, where vulnerabilities might not be exploited due to strong firewalls around factories' infrastructure. In addition, lifetimes of industrial devices were often 20+ years, thus some devices were used over incredible time frames - viewed from an IT perspective. This has fundamentally changed over the last years; <i>digitalization</i> has become not just a buzzword, but now more and more, a reality. OT is now closely connected to external services and networks, and industrial equipment has become powerful devices with major parts in software. Thus, in OT environments, it was vital to adopt widely used software paradigms like vulnerability handling or publishing advisories to make our customers aware of fixed vulnerabilities. Acting as a central PSIRT for all Siemens products, we supported all of our businesses in this changing world, which is a quite challenging task considering the broadness of the Siemens product portfolio and the impressive organizational size of our globally acting company."

Unlike the usual way in IT, we published our advisories in PDF format, which could be printed and read by OT staff, and later we also offered other formats like HTML and CVRF. At that initial time, we received most reports via other CERTs, and we saw quite fast, that we needed to obtain our CVE numbers directly from MITRE for practical reasons. Over the years we increased steadily the number of published advisories and became more and more transparent on our fixed vulnerabilities. We became known to the <a target='_blank' href='https://new.siemens.com/global/en/products/services/cert/hall-of-thanks.html'>researchers</a> and got more vulnerability reports from them directly. In 2017, we partnered with the CVE Program as a <a href='/ResourcesSupport/Glossary?activeTerm=glossaryCNA'>CNA</a> and we were happy that we then were able to have a much easier handling of those CVE number bands, allowing us to increase automation on the advisories as well. At the end of 2018, we introduced our <a target='_blank' href='https://new.siemens.com/global/en/company/stories/research-technologies/cybersecurity/rhythm-for-security.html'>advisory day</a>, and since then all advisories (with some exceptions of a few out-of-band publications) were issued in a regular monthly cycle. This allows our customers to apply all Siemens patches in the same maintenance window as other major software vendors. Considering the variety of our businesses, this was an enormous challenge and was only possible with the great support of our product development teams."
