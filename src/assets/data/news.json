Often the decision is to defer fixing until later, only to be overcome by events or forgotten.” Worse, “vulnerability management programs rely too heavily on the CVSS Base score, produced by vendors and the National Vulnerability Database, in determining the severity and impact of the vulnerability on their operational practices. Vulnerability Management teams often rely solely on the CVSS score assigned to a specific CVE to decide whether or not to fix the CVE in their environment.”"

Of the six vulnerabilities recently added to the KEV, four had CVEs assigned in 2013 and one in 2010. If you are one of the organizations that bases their patching decisions on CVSS scores, do yourself a favor, subscribe to the KEV updates and add fixing those listed in the KEV catalog a priority in your vulnerability management process. It will be a positive step in the right direction.”"

But let us start at the true beginning: <a href='/PartnerInformation/ListofPartners/partner/VulDB'>VulDB</a> launched in 1997. It was a different time back then. When people were talking about vulnerabilities or exploits, they were talking about products: “Did you hear about the new wu-ftpd exploit?” Identifying issues was somehow easier because there were not that many of them, especially not the ones that really drew interest by attackers. If there was potential confusion, people were referring to version numbers of affected products or mentioned technical details such as vulnerable files or exploited functions."

For VulDB to become a CNA, our scope needed to be broader than the CNA Rules currently defines. We discussed this issue with the CVE Program and were able to agree upon a product-independent scope.

At that time, vulnerabilities were often an issue of IT and software vendors, but rarely affected industrial vendors like Siemens. The entire Operational Technologies (OT) world was still considering industrial environments as separated infrastructures, where vulnerabilities might not be exploited due to strong firewalls around factories' infrastructure. In addition, lifetimes of industrial devices were often 20+ years, thus some devices were used over incredible time frames - viewed from an IT perspective. This has fundamentally changed over the last years; <i>digitalization</i> has become not just a buzzword, but now more and more, a reality. OT is now closely connected to external services and networks, and industrial equipment has become powerful devices with major parts in software. Thus, in OT environments, it was vital to adopt widely used software paradigms like vulnerability handling or publishing advisories to make our customers aware of fixed vulnerabilities. Acting as a central PSIRT for all Siemens products, we supported all of our businesses in this changing world, which is a quite challenging task considering the broadness of the Siemens product portfolio and the impressive organizational size of our globally acting company."

Unlike the usual way in IT, we published our advisories in PDF format, which could be printed and read by OT staff, and later we also offered other formats like HTML and CVRF. At that initial time, we received most reports via other CERTs, and we saw quite fast, that we needed to obtain our CVE numbers directly from MITRE for practical reasons. Over the years we increased steadily the number of published advisories and became more and more transparent on our fixed vulnerabilities. We became known to the <a target='_blank' href='https://new.siemens.com/global/en/products/services/cert/hall-of-thanks.html'>researchers</a> and got more vulnerability reports from them directly. In 2017, we partnered with the CVE Program as a <a href='/ResourcesSupport/Glossary?activeTerm=glossaryCNA'>CNA</a> and we were happy that we then were able to have a much easier handling of those CVE number bands, allowing us to increase automation on the advisories as well. At the end of 2018, we introduced our <a target='_blank' href='https://new.siemens.com/global/en/company/stories/research-technologies/cybersecurity/rhythm-for-security.html'>advisory day</a>, and since then all advisories (with some exceptions of a few out-of-band publications) were issued in a regular monthly cycle. This allows our customers to apply all Siemens patches in the same maintenance window as other major software vendors. Considering the variety of our businesses, this was an enormous challenge and was only possible with the great support of our product development teams."
