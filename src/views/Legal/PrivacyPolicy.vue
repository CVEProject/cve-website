                access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction. The CVE Program employs encryption technologies and user authentication procedures
                that are designed to keep data secure. Nevertheless, transmission via the Internet and online digital storage are not completely
                secure, so we cannot guarantee the security of your personal information.

                If you would like to submit a complaint about our use of your personal data or our response to your request regarding your personal

              <h3 class="title">Our Retention of Your Personal Data</h3>
              <p>
                The CVE Program retains your personal data for no longer than is necessary to achieve the purposes for which the personal data
                was collected, or as may otherwise be permitted or required under applicable law. To determine the appropriate retention period,
                we will consider the scope and sensitivity of the personal data; the potential risk of harm from unauthorized access to, use, or
                disclosure of the data; the purposes for which we process the data; whether we can achieve our purposes through other means; our
                business needs; and applicable legal requirements. Unless otherwise required by applicable law, at the end of the retention period,
                we will anonymize or securely destroy your personal data.
              </p>
              <h3 class="title">Personal Data Transfers</h3>
              <p>
                By using the Sites, you acknowledge that your personal data may be collected, transferred to, and processed in jurisdictions
                outside your own. When you directly provide your personal data through our Sites, you acknowledge that your personal data is
                being provided by you to entities based in the United States. The laws that apply to personal data protection in the United States
                differ from those applicable in the EEA and the UK.
              </p>
              <p>
                If it is necessary for us to transfer personal data out of the EEA and the UK, we do so by using suitable data transfer mechanisms,
                such as the standard contractual clauses approved by the European Commission, which impose data protection obligations on parties
                to the transfer.
