                This Notice describes how the CVE<sup>®</sup> Program (“the Program,” “we,” “our,” “us”) uses cookies and tracking
                technologies on its websites (the “Site,” “the Sites”). Like many sites, the Program uses “cookies,” which are small
                data files that can be sent to your web browser and stored on your computer. Cookies that the Program sets are first-party
                cookies. Cookies that we allow others to set are called third-party cookies. The Program uses cookies to distinguish you
                from other users of our website. Cookies also help enable us to improve website performance.

                <p>
                  These cookies are required to provide content that allows the website to function. We process this information to identify
                  visitors to our site, to authenticate site administrators, to set visitor preferences, to help complete forms, and for
                  security purposes.
                </p>
              <h4 class="title">Analytics Cookies</h4>
                <p>
                  These cookies allow us to analyze traffic on the site so that we can measure and improve website performance. These cookies
                  may require your permission before they are activated, depending on your jurisdiction.
                </p>
                <p>
                  We use Google Analytics to measure how users interact with website content. As users navigate between web pages,
                  Google Analytics provides us data, such as applicable URLs, time of visit, time spent on each webpage, type of browser, and
                  type of operating system. With this information, the Program creates, designs, and updates content based on our user interests.
                  In addition, Google Analytics collects indirectly identifiable information, such as users’ IP addresses, unique IDs, and client
                  IDs. Users who do not want their indirectly identifiable information collected during their visit to our website may opt-out of
                  the Google Analytics tracking service at
                    <a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/" target="_blank">

                    </a>
                  or disable analytics cookies through our

              <h4 class="title">Other Cookie Types</h4>
                <p>
                  The Program does not use personalization or targeted advertising cookies. These types of cookies are described at the
