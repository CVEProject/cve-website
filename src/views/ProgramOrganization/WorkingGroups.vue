              CVE Working Groups (WGs) actively focus on improving processes, workflows, and other aspects of the
              program as CVE continues to grow and expand. There are five WGs: Automation (AWG), CNA Coordination (CNACWG),
              Outreach and Communications (OCWG), Strategic Planning (SPWG), and Quality (QWG). Details about
              each WG are found below including information on how to join, as well as links to documents, repositories,
              and projects.
