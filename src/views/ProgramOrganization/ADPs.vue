                      information for CVE Records that meet specific threat characteristics)

                <div>
                  <h4 class="title">CISA ADP Process</h4>
                  <p>
                    The CISA ADP provides a two-pass enrichment for new CVE Records as they are published, starting from February 2024.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    For every new CVE Record, CISA ADP will publish the three relevant decision points in CISA’s SSVC triage process:
                    Exploitation, Automatable, and Technical Impact. This is the first pass of enrichment which all new CVE Records will receive.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    For those CVE Records that score at least one of:
                    <ul>
                      <li>Technical Impact: <span class="has-text-weight-bold">Total</span></li>
                      <li>Automatable: <span class="has-text-weight-bold">Yes</span></li>
                      <li>Exploitation: <span class="has-text-weight-bold">Proof-Of-Concept</span>, or</li>
                      <li>Exploitation: <span class="has-text-weight-bold">Active</span></li>
                    </ul>
                    and are lacking one or more of CVSS, CWE, or CPE data, the CISA ADP will take a second pass of analysis
                    to determine the missing CVSS, CWE, or CPE metric, and add those metrics to the CISA ADP container on those CVE Records.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Of these issues, in some rare cases, it may be impossible to confidently field a guess on CVSS, CWE, or CPE.
                    In those cases, the CISA ADP will not venture such a guess.
                  </p>
                </div>
                <div class="mt-4">
                  <h4 class="title">If a CNA Later Updates the CVE Record</h4>
                  <p>
                    If a CNA later updates a CVE Record with their own CVSS, CWE, or CPE data, the CISA ADP will remove their assessed
                    metrics for those specific elements from the updated CVE Record.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    This approach will reduce duplicate (and conflicting) data within the CVE Record. In the rare event that there is a
                    CVSS, CWE, or CPE string provided by the originating CNA and the CISA ADP, the originating CNA’s data should take
                    precedence for any decision making.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Similarly, if a CVE Record is updated by the originating CNA to provide information that would impact the
                    SSVC decision points, those SSVC decision points will be updated shortly thereafter by the CISA ADP.
