                The CVE Program provides a self-service web interface for reserving CVE IDs and publishing CVE Records. With CVE Services,
                CVE Numbering Authorities (CNAs) save time and reduce costs by directly and efficiently managing their own CVE content.
              </p>
              <p>To begin using the services, you’ll need to:</p>
              <ol>
                <li>
                  <router-link :to="`#${pagePath['Obtaining Credentials']['anchorId']}`">
                    Obtain account credentials</router-link>

                <li>
                  <router-link :to="`#${pagePath['Using CVE Services Clients']['anchorId']}`">
                    Choose and begin using a web-based or command line client</router-link> (for interacting with the services)

              </ol>

                Only CNAs with an active CVE Services User Account (with valid credentials) are eligible to use CVE Services. CNA organizations MUST
                have one or more Organizational Administrators (OAs) and may have any number of individual user accounts.
              </p>
              <p>
                Separate credentials are required for the
                “<router-link to="/AllResources/CveServices#build-your-own-client">CVE Services Test Instance</router-link>.”
                Please use the same process provided below to obtain services account credentials, but specify that you are requesting credentials
                for the test instance.
              </p>
              <h3 class="title" :id="pagePath['Obtaining Credentials']['items']['Organizational Admins'].anchorId">Organizational Administrators</h3>
              <p>Each CNA has one or more CVE Services OAs that will be responsible for:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Managing CVE Services Accounts for the CNA (i.e., creating/deactivating CVE Services Account, resetting user credentials)</li>
                <li>Affirming that each user to whom they grant an account is authorized to manage CVE Records</li>
                <li>Ensuring that there is individual accountability for actions taken by CVE Services users from that CNA:
                  <ul>
                    <li>CVE Services require individuals to authenticate for each transaction and performs individual user logging</li>
                    <li>However, if it is the case that a CNA is using a common account (which is highly discouraged) from which to publish/manage CVE
                      Records, it is the responsibility of that CNA’s OA to maintain individual accountability of who has performed CVE Services
                      transactions on behalf of that CNA
                    </li>

                CNA users obtain accounts through an account request to their CNA’s CVE Services OA. Once granted, the user will receive three pieces
                of information that will be used to authenticate each CVE Services request:

                  is representing. This name must match the “short name” in the CVE Services database.

                <li>
                  <span class="has-text-weight-bold">API Secret:</span> A randomly generated alphanumeric string that will be used to authenticate the
                  user. Each account (i.e., user) has a unique API Secret. These API keys are often used in scripts and custom code and the keys

                If a CNA or individual is interested in fielding its own CVE Services client, the CVE Services Server API documentation will provide
                the interface specification to allow you to develop your own client.

              <h4>Test Environment</h4>
              <p>
                A CVE Services “Test Environment” consisting of the CVE Services test instance API noted above and a
                <a href='https://test.cve.org/' target='_blank'>CVE website test instance</a>
                is available for partners to test the integration of CVE Services into their existing vulnerability management infrastructures. By
                using the test environment, which is completely separate from the official CVE Services, CNAs can assign test CVE IDs and publish and
                edit test CVE Records and view them on the test CVE website with no impact on their official CVE IDs or CVE Records. Partners wishing
                to develop their own CVE Services clients can also use the test environment to verify that their client is working properly. The test
                environment provides for unlimited self-training and process testing as organization’s prepare to adopt the new CVE Services and the
                CVE JSON 5.0 record format.
