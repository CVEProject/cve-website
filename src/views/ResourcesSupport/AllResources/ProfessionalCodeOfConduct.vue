              to adhere to the Professional Code of Conduct. The Code of Conduct also applies to any individual serving in a role on a temporary

            <p>The Secretariat and the Board are responsible for development of the Code of Conduct, and updates or revisions.</p>
            <h2 class="title">Complaints</h2>
            <p>
              Any program participant may report a Code of Conduct complaint. The reporting participant must have directly observed, heard or read
              something thought to be a violation, and be able to provide details about the incident.
            </p>
            <p>
              Complaints must be reported to the Secretariat (cve-prog-secretariat@mitre.org). The Secretariat must maintain the
              confidentiality of the reporter of an incident. The Secretariat will investigate complaints that provide enough
              detail to proceed. The investigation will result in a finding of either “no further action” or “verified.”
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                In cases where the investigation finds that no further action is warranted, the Secretariat will respond back to the reporter with the
                finding result and rationale for the decision.
              </li>
              <li>In cases where the investigation finds verified evidence that the code of conduct was violated, the Secretariat will respond back to
                the reporter about the decision to proceed, and the following actions will commence:
                <ul>
                  <li>The Secretariat will notify the Board about the complaint.</li>
                  <li>
                    The Secretariat will send a message, on behalf of the Board, to the offending party, calling out the unacceptable behavior. The
                    message will explain both the corrective action required and the consequence of failing to correct the inappropriate behavior. It
                    will also explain that repeated behavior of this type may result in removal from the program.
                    <ul>
                      <li>
                        The organization affiliated with the party will also be sent this message, if the complaint is related to an action taken as
                        an agent of that organization.
                      </li>
                    </ul>
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>When the complaint is closed, the Secretariat will respond back to the reporter explaining the actions taken.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              If the individual in question has repeated complaints, the Secretariat will bring this fact to the Board’s attention.
              The Board will then convene an Executive meeting (MITRE Board representative must attend) to review and discuss next steps.
              The Board and the Secretariat will decide on and execute the agreed-to next steps on a case-by-case basis; this may include
              removal of the individual and/or the individual’s organization from the CVE Program.
