            The original concept for what would become the <router-link to='/About/Glossary?activeTerm=glossaryCVEList'>CVE List</router-link> was
            presented by the co-creators of CVE, MITRE Corporation’s
            David E. Mann and Steven M. Christey, as a white paper entitled
            <a href='https://cve.mitre.org/docs/docs-2000/cerias.html' target="_blank">
            <span class='is-italic'>Towards a Common Enumeration of Vulnerabilities</span></a> at the
            <span class='is-italic'>2nd Workshop on Research with Security Vulnerability Databases</span> on January 21-22, 1999 at Purdue
            University in West Lafayette, Indiana, USA.
            </p>
            <p>
            From that original concept, a working group was formed (which would later become the initial 19-member CVE Editorial Board),
            and the original 321 CVE Records were created. The <router-link to='/About/Glossary?activeTerm=glossaryCVEList'>CVE List</router-link> was
            officially launched for the public in September 1999.
            </p>
            <h3>Widespread Adoption of CVE by the Community</h3>
            <p>
            The cybersecurity community endorsed the importance of CVE via "CVE-compatible" products and services from the moment CVE
            was launched in 1999. As quickly as December 2000 there were 29 organizations participating with declarations of compatibility
            for 43 products. Today, those numbers have increased significantly with numerous products and services from around the world
            incorporating CVE Records.
            </p>
            <p>
            Another significant factor to adoption is the ongoing inclusion of CVE IDs in security advisories. Numerous major OS vendors
            and other organizations from around the world include CVE IDs in their alerts to ensure that the international community benefits
            by having the CVE IDs as soon as a problem is announced. In addition, CVE Records are used to uniquely identify vulnerabilities in
            public watch lists such as the <a href='https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Top_Ten_Project' target="_blank">OWASP Top 10 Web
            Application Security
            Issues</a>, among others, and are rated by severity in the <a href='https://www.first.org/cvss/' target="_blank">Common
            Vulnerability Scoring System
            (CVSS)</a>. CVE IDs are also frequently cited in trade publications and general news media reports regarding software bugs; such as
            <a href='https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-0160' target="_blank">CVE-2014-0160</a> for
            “<a href='https://tinyurl.com/ukm1e8vt' target="_blank">
            Heartbleed</a>” and <a href='https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-0708' target="_blank">CVE-2019-0708</a> for
            “<a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BlueKeep' target="_blank">Bluekeep</a>.”
            </p>
            <p>
            Use of CVE by U.S. agencies was recommended by the
            <a href='https://www.nist.gov/index.html' target="_blank">
            National Institute of Standards and Technology
            (NIST)</a> in “<span class='is-italic'>NIST Special Publication (SP) 800-51, Use of the Common Vulnerabilities
            and Exposures (CVE) Vulnerability Naming Scheme</span>,” which was initially released in 2002 and updated in 2011.
            In June 2004, the <a href='https://www.disa.mil/' target="_blank">U.S. Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA)</a> issued a
            task order for information assurance applications that requires the use of products that use CVE IDs.
            </p>
            <p>
            CVE has also been used as the basis for entirely new services. NIST's <a href='https://nvd.nist.gov/' target="_blank">U.S. National
            Vulnerability Database (NVD)</a>
            a “comprehensive cybersecurity vulnerability database that integrates all publicly available U.S. Government vulnerability
            resources and provides
            references to industry resources” is synchronized with, and based on, the CVE List. NVD also includes
            <a href='https://scap.nist.gov/' target="_blank">Security
            Content Automation Protocol (SCAP)</a> mappings for CVE IDs. SCAP is a method for using specific standards to enable
            automated vulnerability
            management, measurement, and policy compliance evaluation (e.g., FISMA compliance) and CVE is one of the open community
            standards SCAP uses for enumerating, evaluating, and measuring the impact of software problems and reporting results. In
            addition, the U.S. <a href='https://nvd.nist.gov/fdcc/index.cfm' target="_blank">
            Federal Desktop Core Configuration (FDCC)</a> requires verification of compliance with FDCC requirements using
            SCAP-validated scanning tools.
            <a href='https://cassandra.cerias.purdue.edu/CVE_changes/' target="_blank">CVE Change Logs</a> is a tool created by
            <a href='http://www.cerias.purdue.edu/' target="_blank">
            CERIAS/Purdue University</a> that monitors additions and changes to the CVE List and allows users to obtain daily or
            monthly reports.
            <a href='https://oval.cisecurity.org/' target="_blank">Open Vulnerability and Assessment Language (OVAL)</a>, operated by the
            <a href='https://www.cisecurity.org/' target="_blank">
            Center for Internet Security</a>, is a standard for determining the machine state of a computer systems using
            community-developed OVAL Vulnerability
            Definitions that are based primarily on CVE Records. The <a href='https://cwe.mitre.org/' target="_blank">Common Weakness Enumeration
            (CWE™)</a> is a formal
            dictionary of common software weaknesses that is based in part on the 145,000+ CVE Records on the CVE List.
            </p>
            <p>
            And in 2011, the <a href='https://www.itu.int/en/pages/default.aspx' target="_blank">International Telecommunication Union’s (ITU-T)</a>
            Cybersecurity Rapporteur
            Group, which is the telecom/information system standards body within the treaty-based 150-year-old intergovernmental
            organization, adopted CVE as
            a part of its new “<a href='https://www.itu.int/en/ITU-T/studygroups/com17/Pages/cybex.aspx' target="_blank">Global Cybersecurity
            Information Exchange techniques
            (X.CYBEX)”</a> by issuing <a href='https://www.itu.int/ITU-T/recommendations/rec.aspx?rec=11061' target="_blank">Recommendation ITU-T
            X.1520 Common Vulnerabilities
            and Exposures (CVE)</a>, was based upon the former CVE Compatibility Program’s archived <span class='is-italic'>
            Requirements and Recommendations
            for CVE Compatibility</span> document.
            </p>
            <h3>CVE Continues to Grow</h3>
            <p>
            In 2016, the CVE Program began actively expanding the number of organizations participating as
            <router-link to='/ProgramOrganization/CNAs'>CVE
            Numbering Authorities (CNAs)</router-link>. CNAs are how the <router-link to='/About/Glossary?activeTerm=glossaryCVEList'>
            CVE List</router-link>
            is built. Every <router-link to='/About/Glossary?activeTerm=glossaryRecord'>CVE Record</router-link> is added by a CNA.
            This expansion continues
            today with more and more organizations from around the world deciding to partner with the CVE Program to
            <router-link to='/PartnerInformation/Partner'>become a CNA</router-link>.

            From 2001 through 2005 the CVE Senior Advisory Council ensured that the CVE Program received the sponsorshipincluding funding and guidance
            required to maximize the effectiveness of the program in supporting government efforts to improve the nation’s ability to
            identify and respond
            to vulnerabilities and information assurance attacks or issues. The council was composed of senior executives listed
            below from within the U.S.
            Federal government responsible for information assurance. We thank them for their valuable contributions during that time.
