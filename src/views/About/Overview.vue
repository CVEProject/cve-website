              The mission of the CVE<sup>®</sup> Program is to identify,
              define, and catalog publicly disclosed cybersecurity
              <router-link to="/ResourcesSupport/Glossary?activeTerm=glossaryVulnerability">vulnerabilities</router-link>. There is one
              <router-link to="/ResourcesSupport/Glossary?activeTerm=glossaryRecord">CVE Record</router-link> for each
              vulnerability in the catalog. The vulnerabilities are discovered then assigned and published
              by organizations from around the world that have partnered with the CVE Program.
              <router-link to="/PartnerInformation/ListofPartners">Partners</router-link> publish CVE Records to communicate
              consistent descriptions of vulnerabilities. Information technology and cybersecurity professionals use
              CVE Records to ensure they are discussing the same issue, and to coordinate their efforts to prioritize and
              address the vulnerabilities.
