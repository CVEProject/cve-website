                 CVE and NVD are separate programs. The <a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/" target="_blank">U.S. National Vulnerability
                 Database (NVD)</a> was launched by the <a href="https://www.nist.gov/" target="_blank">National Institute of
                 Standards and Technology (NIST)</a> in 2005, while the
                 <router-link to='/About/Glossary?activeTerm=glossaryCVEList'>CVE List</router-link> was launched by
                 <router-link to="/ResourcesSupport/FAQs#pc_introMITRE_role_in_cve">MITRE</router-link> as a community
                 effort in 1999.
               </p>
               <p>
                 NVD is a vulnerability database built upon and fully synchronized with the CVE List so
                 that any updates to CVE appear immediately in NVD.
               </p>
               <p>
                 The CVE List <span class="is-italic">feeds</span> NVD, which then builds upon the information
                 included in CVE Records to provide enhanced information for each CVE Record such as:
                 <ul>
                   <li>Severity scores and impact ratings</li>
                   <li>CPE information</li>
                   <li>Fix information</li>
                   <li>Searching by OS; by vendor name, product name, and/or version number; and by
                      vulnerability type, severity, related exploit range, and impact</li>
                   <li>Enhanced CVE content data feeds:</li>
                   <ul>
                     <li>JSON Vulnerability Feed</li>
                     <li>RSS Vulnerability Feeds</li>
                     <li>Vulnerability Translation Feeds</li>
                     <li>Vulnerability Vendor Statements</li>

              The <a href="https://www.first.org/cvss/" target="_blank">CVSS</a> standard operated by the
              <a href="https://www.first.org/" target="_blank">Forum of Incident
              Response and Security Teams (FIRST)</a>, which is a separate program from CVE, can be used to score the severity of software
              vulnerabilities identified by CVE Records. In general, severity scores for CVE Records are provided by NVD, but some CVE Records
              on the CVE List include severity ratings if the CNA publishing the record decides to includes them.
            </p>
            <p>
              CVSS Version 3.0 provides “a way to capture the principal characteristics of a vulnerability, and
              produce a numerical score reflecting its severity, as well as a textual representation of that
              score. The numerical score can then be translated into a qualitative representation (such as low,
              medium, high, and critical) to help organizations properly assess and prioritize their vulnerability
              management processes.”
            </p>
            <p>
              CVE Records are cited in the CVSS specification and documentation to identify individual vulnerabilities used as examples, but
              they are not required for using CVSS.

              Severity rating scoring and prioritization for CVE Records is available through a

              According to the NVD website, which is operated by the <a href="https://www.nist.gov/" target="_blank">National Institute of
              Standards and
              Technology (NIST)</a>, NVD’s CVSS calculator for CVE Records supports both the CVSS 2.0 and CVSS 3.0 standards and provides
              qualitative severity rankings for CVE Records using each version. In addition, NVD’s CVSS calculator also allows users to add
              two additional types of score data into their severity scoring: (1) temporal, for “metrics that change over time due to events
              external to the vulnerability,” and (2) environmental, for “scores customized to reflect the impact of the vulnerability on
              your organization.” For details and help, visit <a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss" target="_blank">

              <a href="https://cwe.mitre.org/" target="_blank">CWE™</a> is a community-developed taxonomy of
              common software and
              hardware security weaknesses that serves as a common language, a measuring stick for security tools, and as a baseline for
              weakness identification, mitigation, and prevention efforts. Weaknesses in software and hardware may become exploitable
              vulnerabilities if not eliminated prior to software or hardware deployment. Weaknesses are a required data element in a CVE Record.
