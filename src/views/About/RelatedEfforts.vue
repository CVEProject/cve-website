                 CVE and NVD are separate programs. The
                 <a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/" target="_blank">U.S. National Vulnerability Database (NVD)</a>
                 was launched by the
                 <a href="https://www.nist.gov/" target="_blank">National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)</a>
                 in 2005, while the
                 <router-link to='/ResourcesSupport/Glossary?activeTerm=glossaryCVEList'>CVE List</router-link>
                 was launched by

                 as a community effort in 1999. The CVE List feeds NVD, which historically has built upon the information included
                 in CVE Records to provide enhanced information for each record in its database. While separate, output from both
                 programs is available to the public and free to use.

              enables CNAs to include CVSS scores in their CVE Records when publishing them to the CVE List.
            </p>
            <p>
              CVSS provides “provides a way to capture the principal characteristics of a vulnerability and produce a numerical score
              reflecting its severity. The numerical score can then be translated into a qualitative representation (such as low, medium,
              high, and critical) to help organizations properly assess and prioritize their vulnerability management processes.”
            </p>
            <p>
              CVE Records are cited in the CVSS specification and documentation to identify individual vulnerabilities used as examples, but
              they are not required for using CVSS.

              is a community-developed taxonomy of common software and hardware security weaknesses that serves as a common language,
              a measuring stick for security tools, and as a baseline for weakness identification, mitigation, and prevention efforts.
              Weaknesses in software and hardware may become exploitable vulnerabilities if not eliminated prior to software or hardware deployment.

              The CWE Program also has special interest groups (SIGs) and working groups (WGs) for community participation, including the
