                 CVE and NVD are separate programs. The <a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/" target="_blank">U.S. National Vulnerability
                 Database (NVD)</a> was launched by the <a href="https://www.nist.gov/" target="_blank">National Institute of
                 Standards and Technology (NIST)</a> in 2005, while the
                 <router-link to='/ResourcesSupport/Glossary?activeTerm=glossaryCVEList'>CVE List</router-link> was launched by
                 <router-link to="/ResourcesSupport/FAQs#pc_introMITRE_role_in_cve">The MITRE Corporation</router-link> as a community

                 NVD is a vulnerability database built upon — and fully synchronized with — the CVE List so that any updates to CVE appear
                 immediately in NVD.

               <p>
                 The CVE List <span class="is-italic">feeds</span> NVD, which then builds upon the information
                 included in CVE Records to provide enhanced information for each CVE Record such as:
                 <ul>
                   <li>Severity scores and impact ratings</li>
                   <li>Common Platform Enumeration (CPE) information</li>

                   <li>Searching by OS; by vendor name, product name, and/or version number; and by
                      vulnerability type, severity, related exploit range, and impact</li>

              <a href="https://www.first.org/" target="_blank">Forum of Incident
              Response and Security Teams (FIRST)</a>, which is a separate program from CVE, can be used to score the severity of software
              vulnerabilities identified by CVE Records. In general, severity scores for CVE Records are provided by NVD, but some CVE Records
              on the CVE List include severity ratings if the CNA publishing the record decides to include them.
            </p>
            <p>
              CVSS Version 3.0 provides “a way to capture the principal characteristics of a vulnerability, and
              produce a numerical score reflecting its severity, as well as a textual representation of that
              score. The numerical score can then be translated into a qualitative representation (such as low,
              medium, high, and critical) to help organizations properly assess and prioritize their vulnerability
              management processes.”
            </p>
            <p>
              CVE Records are cited in the CVSS specification and documentation to identify individual vulnerabilities used as examples, but
              they are not required for using CVSS.

              Standards and
              Technology (NIST)</a>, NVD’s CVSS calculator for CVE Records supports both the CVSS 2.0 and CVSS 3.0 standards and provides
              qualitative severity rankings for CVE Records using each version. In addition, NVD’s CVSS calculator also allows users to add
              two additional types of score data into their severity scoring: (1) temporal, for “metrics that change over time due to events
              external to the vulnerability,” and (2) environmental, for “scores customized to reflect the impact of the vulnerability on
              your organization.” For details and help, visit <a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss" target="_blank">
